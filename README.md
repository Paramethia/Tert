# Tert

This is my first C# program. A text to binary converter. Also thought I should add the feature to reverse text. Also convert the binary back to text. You can perhaps use it as a fun little sercret tool to have a sectret conversation in a group chat in reverse or binary. Eventually, I might add hex, octal, etc as well. This project, and learning c# helped me learn a little more about computers and how programming works in the deep end. Can't wait to work on bigger projects with this language. It is honestly intriguiing.
